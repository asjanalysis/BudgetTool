# BudgetTool

Single-page web tool for turning a budget spreadsheet into a consolidated PDF report.

All processing happens in your browser—no data is stored or uploaded to a server.

2. Upload the Excel budget file and click **Load expenses** to parse it.
3. For each expense, optionally attach an invoice and a proof of payment (PDF, PNG, or JPG).
4. Click **Generate report PDF** to download the consolidated report.
